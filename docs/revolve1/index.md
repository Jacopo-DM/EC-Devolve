    As of 2022 [Revolve 2](https://ci-group.github.io/revolve2/index.html) has been released.
    Meaning this documentation is likely obsolete.

## The Revolve Wiki

When installing revolve, one may find themselves on the [Revolve GitHub page](https://github.com/ci-group/revolve).

Here we can find two contradictory instructions:

- ['Installation' Header on the main page](https://github.com/ci-group/revolve#installation)
- [Installation Instructions for Revolve](https://github.com/ci-group/revolve/wiki/Installation-Instructions-for-Revolve)

Both assume [dependencies](https://github.com/ci-group/revolve/wiki/Installation-Instructions-for-Gazebo)
which I will cover in the following sections.

Now, let's start our exploration and digital adventure.
I'll blend the two instructions until I can make it work.

## Disclaimer
This is a write-up of the steps I (Jacopo Di Matteo)
took to make Revolve work on my M1 mac,
I wrote them for two reasons:

1. In case I need to repeat the installation process at a later date
2. In case anyone needs to install Revolve on an M1 mac and wants to know what I did

I also assume you followed ALL the steps in order.

I can't promise it will work for you, in the past, present or future;
nor do I offer multiple ways to do things
(eg. I use the Miniforge installation of Conda, thus I have no clue about normal Conda).

Feel free to ask me any questions you may have :)
