## Introduction

Welcome to Jacopo Di Matteo's "Evolutionary Computing" dev-log :)

On this page, I have documented the work I've done for the "Advanced Research Assignment" of the "[Evolutionary Computing (X_400111)](https://research.vu.nl/en/publications/evolutionary-computing)" course,
taken at the [Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam](https://vu.nl/en).

Its primary function is to act as a tutorial or guide to prospective students facing technical hurdles similar to my own.
